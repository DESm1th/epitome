Here's some not-so-pretty code for RVT regressor creation that you can
take a crack at reverse engineering when the time comes.

Heck, I might as well send it all while I'm at it. Here's a small legend
describing the attached scripts:

1) RVTbatch.m: takes physio data as input -- in some form -- and spits out
regressors for RVT. I believe there is also a companion program for this
that strips off 3 (unwanted) columns of the 6 it produces, and maybe
something else...I'll track it down.
2) td.loc.prep: some initial preprocessing for task data
3) td.loc.regressNoise: This follows the last script, and is used when
doing the full ANATICORR noise regression on task data, which, as I
mentioned, I did with my blocked localizer task data.
4) td.loc.prep.NEW: does the GLM on either the simply preprocessed data,
or the fully noise regressed data (I think).

Go wild.
