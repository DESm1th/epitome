motion_deskull
--------------
Usage: motion_deskull <func_prefix> <data_quality> <masking> <mask_method>

+ func_prefix -- functional data prefix (eg., smooth in func_smooth).
+ masking -- EPI brain masking tolerance. One of 'loosest', 'loose', 'normal', or 'tight'.
+ mask_method -- FSL == 'bet', AFNI == '3dAutomask'.

This motion corrects your data, saves the motion parameters, calculates a whole brain EPI mask, and then applies this to all runs of your data.

Masking options are provided to improve masking performance across various acquisition types, but it is very hard to devise a simple one-size fits all solution for this option. Therefore the QC outputs will be very important for ensuring good masking, and these options may need to be tweaked on a site-by-site basis. Luckily, many analysis methods do not rely heavily on mask accuracy. In cases that do, such as partial least squares / ICA / PCA analysis, close attention should be paid to the output of this step. Hopefully the 'loose', 'normal', and 'tight' nomenclature are self-explanatory. Generally, it is best to start with normal, and adjust if required.

If this script finds an initTR file (generated by the a low-quality option in init_*), then it motion-corrects and deskulls it (to be used by one of the registration scripts).

Prerequisites: init_*.

Outputs: deskull.
