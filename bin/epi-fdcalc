"""
Calculates the framewise displacement from a submitted AFNI-formatted motion
paramater (.1D) file. This gets written out as an n-length vector in a text file
(n = number of TRs).

If the option --mean is set to a file, the average framewise displacement is
also written out for that subject.

This program assumes a head radius of 50 mm.

Usage:
    epi-fdcalc [options] <motion> <output>

Arguments:
    <motion>        full path to input AFNI motion paramater file.
    <output>        full path to output text file.

Options:
    --mean=<mean>   full path to output mean FD calculation
