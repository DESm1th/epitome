This is the source code for the York University MRI Pipeline.
Mostly written by Joseph D Viviano 2013-2014.

This project should be fairly easy to use with minor tweaks by using the
GUI website. Each module can also be used manually by those who know
what they are doing.

Please contact joseph.d.viviano@gmail.com with any questions!
